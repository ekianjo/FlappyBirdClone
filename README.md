FlappyBirdClone
===============

A Flappy Bird Clone made using python-pygame and adapted for the Open Pandora handheld. Original code by sourabhv, modifications made by Ekianjo. 

How-to
------

1. On the Open Pandora, from firmware 1.60 you should have Python 2.7 and Pygame by default in the firmware, so there is no need to install anything. 

2. Just run in terminal the run.sh command : ./run.sh and that should do it.
