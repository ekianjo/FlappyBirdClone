FlappyBirdClone
===============

A Flappy Bird Clone made using python-pygame and adapted for the Open Pandora handheld. Original code by sourabhv, modifications made by Ekianjo. Key modifications include:

- flappy.py: Screen resized to 800*480 by default.
- flappy.py: Resizing of certain assets like backgrounds and base.png to fit the new screen size
- flappy.py: Increased the numbers of random pipes to 5 at once in order to fill the screen with pipes on 800*480 resolution
- flappy.py: adjusted the position of the base at the bottom of the screen.
- Added run.sh script to handle specific OMAP drivers instructions for the Pandora.

How-to
------

1. On the Open Pandora, from firmware 1.60 you should have Python 2.7 and Pygame by default in the firmware, so there is no need to install anything. 

2. Just run in terminal the run.sh command : ./run.sh and that should do it.
